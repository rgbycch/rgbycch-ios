# rgbycch-ios

iOS app for the rgbycch service.

# Getting Started
To run and build a version of the application, you'll need the latest versions of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and [cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org) installed on your machine. Once you have those two prerequisites, execute the following:

    git clone https://github.com/rgbycch/rgbycch-ios.git --recursive
    pod install
    open rgbycch-ios.xcworkspace

Xcode should open and you should be given the option to run the application on your simulator of choice.

# Contributing
Contributions to the development of the iOS application are always welcome. Some guidelines:
- If you **found a bug**, _and can provide steps to reliably reproduce it_, open an issue.
- If you **have a feature request**, open an issue.
- If you **want to contribute**, submit a pull request.

There's a simple well-intentioned [Code of Conduct](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/2/0/code_of_conduct.txt) for any community that might spring up around the development of the app too.
